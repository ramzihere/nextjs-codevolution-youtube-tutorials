# Lecture 5: Routing

Next.js has a file-system based routing mechanism.
URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.

## Routing Conventions

All routes must be placed inside **app** folder.
Every file that corresponds to a route must be named **page.js** or **page.tsx**.
Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.
